# About Me 

<img align="left" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e5d28121-61a4-443a-adf3-d8137785d633">
&nbsp; I am a biomechanics student attending Marshall University. The combination of my involvement with Marshall's biomechanics program and commitmentment in Divison 1 athletics has sparked a personal interest in exploring footwear alternatives that may enhance athletic performance by prioritizing biomechanical advantages in product design.

## Biomechanics Projects


### The Acute Effect of Footwear on Proprioception and Environment Spatial Perception
I am currently recruiting and scheduling the participation of athletic individuals to partake in data collection of this project. To gather data, I accurately place IMUs, EMGs, and reflective markers on respective bony and muscular landmarks on the individual and construct a unique 3D model of their anatomy using Vicon Nexus. I provide instructions to the participant and use force plates to assist in data collection.


#### Isokinetic Dynamometer Testing
Using an isokinetic dynamometer, I provided a right-to-left comparison of force production in the leg for an individual who underwent ACL reconstruction. Varying speeds of 60 and 180 deg/sec were utilized to measure strength and power generation. Evaluated movements included knee extension/flexion and ankle plantar/dorsiflexion (supine).
