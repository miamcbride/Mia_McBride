## Biomechanics Projects

### The Acute Effect of Footwear on Proprioception and Environment Spatial Perception
I am currently recruiting and scheduling the participation of athletic individuals to partake in data collection of this project. To gather data, I accurately place IMUs, EMGs, and reflective markers on respective bony and muscular landmarks on the individual and construct a unique 3D model of their anatomy using Vicon Nexus. I provide instructions to the participant and use force plates to assist in data collection.
