# About Me 

<img align="left" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e5d28121-61a4-443a-adf3-d8137785d633">
&nbsp;I am a biomechanics student attending Marshall University. The 
&nbsp;combination of my work with Marshall's biomechanics program and 
&nbsp;commitment in Divison 1 athletics has sparked a personal interest in 
&nbsp;researching footwear alternatives that may enhance athletic performance by 
&nbsp;prioritizing biomechanically driven design.

## Biomechanics Projects

### The Acute Effect of Footwear on Proprioception and Environment Spatial Perception
This project aims to evaluate the effect of textured insoles on proprioception when performing athletic movements. I am currently recruiting and scheduling athletic individuals to partake in data collection of this project. To gather data, I accurately place EMG electrodes and a Helen Hayes marker set on respective muscular and bony landmarks on the individual and construct a unique 3D model of their anatomy using Vicon Nexus. Our lab incorporates the use of force plates within the motion capture system to gather data. I provide instructions to the participant and capture their trials.

### Sports Performance Data Analysis
I work alongside Marshall's sports science group to interpret dynamic movement data for Marshall University's sports teams, including baseball and women's basketball to track athletic performance. Athletes perform a single-leg and double-leg countermovement jump and a single-leg landing onto force plates. After the force plate data are processed, I discuss with the sports science group to ensure a mutual understanding and articulation of data present. Following these discussions, I interpret these data into summaries for the athletes, which are then composed into reports of monthly athletic performance comparisons. Calculated variables are listed below: 
- Single-leg and Double-Leg Countermovement Jumps: **Jump height**, **maximum power**, countermovement depth, concentric impulse

- Single-leg Landings: **Shock absorption time**, rate of force displacement, dynamic postural stability index

### Post ACL Reconstruction Isokinetic Dynamometer Testing
This project aimed to evaluate symmetry of an individual's lower leg muscular function after ACL reconstruction. Using an isokinetic dynamometer, I provided a right-to-left comparison of force production in the leg for an individual who underwent ACL reconstruction. Varying speeds of 60 and 180 deg/sec were utilized to measure strength and power generation. Evaluated movements included knee extension/flexion and ankle plantar/dorsiflexion (supine). A muscular defecit in the left leg was noted.[Isokinetic Dynamometer Report](https://github.com/miamcbride/Mia_McBride/blob/main/IsokineticDynamometerReport.pdf)

### In-field Gait Data Collection and Analysis
I wanted to compare gait pattern differences with a focus on ankle stability in coordinated vs. uncoordinated individuals. I tested two individuals, one who was coordinated(S2), and one who was less coordinated, with arthritis in the ankle area(S1). I used IMUs to track gait patterns in 3-dimensional planes when walking on different surfaces (indoor, stairs, uneven gravel). I evaluated trunk stability by calculating RMS jerk taken from an IMU placed on C7. I evaluated multi-limb coordination by tracking angular velocities of limb segments, calculating those values into joint angles and then creating angle-angle graphs of the knee-ankle. 
<br /><br />
I found a higher degree of movement pattern variability and inefficiency exhibited by the uncoordinated individual(S1) than their counterpart(S2).
