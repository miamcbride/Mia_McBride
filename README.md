# About Me 

<img align="left" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e5d28121-61a4-443a-adf3-d8137785d633">
&nbsp;I am a biomechanics student attending Marshall University. The 
&nbsp;combination of my involvement with Marshall's biomechanics program and 
&nbsp;commitmentment in Divison 1 athletics has sparked a personal interest in 
&nbsp;exploring footwear alternatives that may enhance athletic performance by 
&nbsp;prioritizing biomechanical advantages in product design.

## Biomechanics Projects

### The Acute Effect of Footwear on Proprioception and Environment Spatial Perception
I am currently recruiting and scheduling the participation of athletic individuals to partake in data collection of this project. To gather data, I accurately place IMUs, EMGs, and reflective markers on respective bony and muscular landmarks on the individual and construct a unique 3D model of their anatomy using Vicon Nexus. I provide instructions to the participant and use force plates to assist in data collection.

### Sports Science Data Analysis
I work alongside with Marshall's biomechanics master's students in interpret dynamic movement data for Marshall University's sports teams, including baseball and women's basketball. Taking data collected from force plates, I interpret single and double leg countermovement jumps and single-leg landings. Extracted data is listed below: 
- Single-leg Countermovement Jumps: Jump height, maximum power, countermovement depth, concentric impulse
- Double-leg Countermovement Jumps: Jump height, maximum power, countermovement depth, concentric impulse
- Single-leg Landings: Shock absorption time, rate of force displacement, dynamic postural stability index

I interpret these data into summaries for the athletes, which are then composed into reports of monthly athletic performance comparisons.

### Isokinetic Dynamometer Testing
Using an isokinetic dynamometer, I provided a right-to-left comparison of force production in the leg for an individual who underwent ACL reconstruction. Varying speeds of 60 and 180 deg/sec were utilized to measure strength and power generation. Evaluated movements included knee extension/flexion and ankle plantar/dorsiflexion (supine).

### Gait Data Collection and Analysis
Used IMUs to track joint movement in x, y, and z planes when walking on different surfaces (indoor, stairs, uneven gravel). Trunk stability was evaluated by calculating RMS jerk taken from an IMU placed on C7. Multi-limb coordination was evaluated by tracking angular velocities of lower limb segments and then creating angle-angle graphs of the knee-ankle.
